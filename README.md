👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate Backend & Machine Learning Engineer currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at JSS Academy of Technical Education, Bengaluru (Class of 2026). I specialize in building scalable, containerized RESTful APIs, data pipelines, and intelligent ML architectures.

🔭 I’m currently working as a Part-Time Backend Engineer at Nez Development Studios, building fault-tolerant trade replication systems.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source, ML pipelines, and Web3/Decentralized apps.

🌱 I’m currently exploring advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures and distributed systems.

⚡ Fun fact: I love optimizing database-backed state management and orchestrating event-driven architectures!
